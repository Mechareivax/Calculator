# Calculator

This is an app building exercise from The Odin Project focusing on HTML and CSS styling, DOM manipulation, and JavaScript.

Issues:
 - There is an error about not being able to resolve the toFixed method on line 126 that I cannot consistently replicate, but happens occasionally when using the mouse to do a simple calculation, then the keyboard to do it again. So something like using the mouse to enter 12, then plus, then 8, then equals (displays 20), then immediately entering in those same inputs with the keyboard.
